#                                     'Jessica Sarah spent much of her childhood in Australia training and
# competing as a gymnast.
# It wasn\'t until she turned sixteen that Jessica picked up her dad\'s guitar for the first time.
# After spending a few months learning to play,
# she began writing songs and fell in love with the idea of creating and singing her own original music.
# Dreaming was one of the first songs that Jessica self-penned acoustically, before going on to write and
# record material for her debut EP Wooden Seas.',

#                                     'In early 2013 Jessica was heard rehearsing for an open mic session at the famous Aussie event,
# Woodford Folk Festival, by Darren Percival from The Voice. As he walked past, Darren stopped in his tracks and
# invited Jessica to play with him at the Pineapple lounge in front of her first packed house.
# <br><br>
# Jessica recorded the six original songs for Wooden Seas in the first half of 2013. The release received the attention of
# Australian Broadcasting Corporation ABC station Triple J and after air play, she was interviewed by announcer Rosie Beaton.
# Jessica was offered the honour to have her songs placed in the ABC library, available for the use of secondary school students in their film projects.
# A few months later Jessica was recognised for her talents after entering the national First Break competition and was awarded a place in the top thirty.ï¿¼
# <br><br>
# Now just finished high school,
# this talented singer and songwriter has been fielding offers from internationally signed acts to write lyrics and melodies for their songs.
# Jessica\'s creativity and love for song writing has made her determined to pursue a career in the music industry.',
